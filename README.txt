- this is probably all wrong

* running in repl.it
    - import the git repo:
        - https://repl.it/new/cpp
        - select import from GitHub
        - cmake is included in the repl env

* running locally (recommend downloading clion)
    - install cmake: https://cmake.org/install/
    $ cmake --build .
    $ ./build/main
